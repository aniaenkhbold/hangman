# hangman

This project uses SMFL drawing with C++ to create a game of hangman. The user chooses letters to guess the unknown word chosen randomly from a pool of words. If the player chooses a letter that is not in the word, the hangman starts drawing. Once the hangman if complete, the player loses. If the player chooses the word correctly, the player wins.
